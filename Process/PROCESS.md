## Notes from meeting of 2017-06-13 at The Warehouse

### What is it 'about'?

* The poetics/aesthetics of chess
* Narrative/drama/tension of chess
* The vertigo feeling of chess (possibilities)
* Movement and space

### Who are you?

* Play as the king? Play as any piece ('classes')?
* Play as a party with the king as the player's "real avatar" (the one whose death triggers loss)
  - Some number of points to create your party with (could take all pawns, two queens, etc.)

### Turn taking

* How do you work out the turn order?
* All pieces of one colour move, then the other color
  - All move at once? What about conflicts?
  - Move in random order? Rank order? Proximity to enemy?
* When it's the player's turn simplify their life by determining which piece they need to move 'now' and cycle through their pieces for them?
  - This reduces a certain level of strategy as it matters which piece you move when (only if players alternate moving one piece each as in chess)

### Space

* What happens when you reach an 'exit'
  - Go down in levels of dungeon
* Will have potential issues like corridor widths for pieces like bishops and knights
* Is the whole space visible the whole time? Fog of war? Spaces that extend beyond the screen or smaller 'puzzle-like' levels (as in Hoplite)?

### Game structure

* Is there an ending or infinite dungeons?
* There could be the enemy king on a specific level, like the 10th or 20th, and if you capture him you win
* Think about things like Michael Brough's 868-HACK which solves the replayability thing by encouraging people to make multiple runs without dying (all this only really matters if we're getting serious about leaderboards though)
