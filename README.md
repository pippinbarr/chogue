# Chogue

_Look! Up in the sky! It's a Chess Rogue-like! It's a Rogue Chess-like! No! It's Chogue! Faster than a Blitz Chess player who just drank a Potion of Haste! More powerful than than a Sicilian Dragon! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! It's the Chogue that refreshes!_

_Chogue_ is a hybrid game created out of two masterpieces, chess and _Rogue_, by [Jonathan Lessard](http://jonathanlessard.net/) and [Pippin Barr](http://pippinbarr.com/). Throughout its design and development we followed the (fairly) strict rule of making decisions that meant _Chogue_ corresponded either to chess or to _Rogue_ in each of its elements, from its spatial layout (_Rogue_) to its movement style (chess) to its combat system (chess) to its overall gameplay structure (_Rogue_). The result is a game that is as least as good as _Rogue_ and chess put together. If not better than that.
